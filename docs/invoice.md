## ðŸ§  Project Description

MELI faced a severe malfunction in its **order management system** due to misconfigurations in production satellites and database node failures.  
These issues caused interruptions in order processing, financial losses, and customer dissatisfaction.

The proposed solution rebuilt and stabilized the backend architecture using **Spring Boot 3.0**, ensuring **robustness, scalability, and environment segmentation** (dev, test, prod).  
Through proper PostgreSQL integration, Swagger documentation, and automated testing, the platform reached a high level of maintainability and performance.
